                    <p>I've spent the last two years cutting my teeth in full-stack web development going through highly recommended online courses and building an array of personal projects some of which you'll see on the next page. I enjoy programming at either end of the tech stack whether it's creating data models and optimizing database queries, or animating SVG's and creating fluid digital experiences.</p>

                <h2>A Brief History...</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Cascadia College with an associate's degree in business and an acceptance letter to the University of Washington in hand and decided to drop it all and pursue music. I found myself not as motivated as I'd thought I would feel as time went on and one day decided to try my hand at programming. I started the journey taking Harvard's intro to computer science course and haven't looked back since. I'm still a guitar enthusiast and love to write and play music, but I've found my true passion and professional calling in programming.</p>
